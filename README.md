# Brain-Tumor-Extraction-From-MRI-images
This project aims to segment the tumor from MRI images using different image segmentation techniques. Template matching is also performed to compare the extracted tumor with the template tumor in order to check the accuracy of the extracted tumor.  Achieved an accuracy of 85% in extracting the right tumor region from the brain images
